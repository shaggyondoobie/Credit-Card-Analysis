# Credit-Card-Analysis
This project shows the credit card utilization of customers across various states in USA. 
We have used Power Query editor to process the data and used DAX formulas to create calcualted columns and measures before creating visualizations in Power View.
There were some clear patterns present in the data maximum revenue being generated by Businessmen followed by white-collar jobs.
The maximum revenue was being contributed between age group 40-60 which should give a fair idea of the target customers.
70% of the revenue is being generated by three states namely California, Texas and New York.
The Platinum card has the worst CSAT score and the least number of scores so would make sense to discontinue that particualr card.
